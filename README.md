## Projet Title: 

### manifold_project

## Projet Description: 

This code was made for the Manifold Learning projet for the Master Data Mining of University Lyon 2 in 2021. 
The code has the utilization of MDS, Isomap and t-SNE in the simulated datasets Swissroll, Sphere and Borromean Ring and the real dataset Wine for dimensionaliy reduction analysis and comparision. 
This code also has some experiments and comparision tecnhiques and some parameter tuning. 

This code is written on R with the help of some standard libraries. 

## How to Run: 

The main code is separate into three files: manifold_experiments.R , manifold_comparision.R and manifold_real_data.R 
To use these scripts you should load the functions inside the files manifold_function.R , trustworthiness.R and continuity.R 

Each main code is separated into sections that correspond to the demanded experiments in the projects instructions. 

Exemples: 
    Run the above codes in R studio and first load all the functions and afterwards test each part of the R files 
    according to your need.
